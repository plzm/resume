      "reference": "Patrick worked for me as a contractor at Microsoft for slightly over 1 year. His core responsibility was providing internal employees across the company with remediation support to improve the security of their Azure subscriptions. I can recall my first interaction with Patrick – it was to determine if he was a good fit for the role. He was very well prepared, precise and calculated, and amazed me. It was a no-brainer to bring him on and it was like finding a diamond in the rough. Patrick would go on to amaze me throughout his engagement. \n\nHere are 3 things that stood out about Patrick:\n1.\tTechnical Excellence: Patrick really knows his stuff, especially Azure. He is the type to dig in, reproduce an issue for his own learning and to put himself in the shoes of the customer. He is naturally the type that likes to learn by doing. He thinks outside the box on how to solve different technical challenges.\n2.\tContributions to the Success of Others: Patrick is a nature born leader. He is not only a great employee, but a peer to his co-workers. He volunteers to help them and is genuinely interested in helping them learn and grow. For example, Patrick put together a set of PowerShell scripts to make his job easier and documented his learnings throughout his engagement in a OneNote. He shared these with his peers (even though nobody asked him to) and these resources are now used as onboarding guides for new hires. Often times, his peers will come to him for help and he is always willing to partner.\n3.\tExcellent Communications and Customer Service Skills: One of Patrick’s biggest strengths is his ability to explain the most complex technical issue to a non-technical person. This makes him very versatile in being able to influence a diverse range of audience from senior management to hardcore engineers. I never hesitated to bring Patrick into a meeting with senior leadership as he intuitively knew at what altitude to keep the conversation. Customers raved about working with Patrick and his outstanding customer service – he was a key reason why we were able to achieve an all time high customer satisfaction score. Finally, Patrick is accountable for what he says and does. I never had to follow-up with him. He was great at managing up, setting expectations, and always exceeded my expectations.\n\nThank you Patrick for helping to make Microsoft more secure. I hope we get to work together again really soon!"
